waiting for a runtime error: fail early!

Version 0.2.3
- modules can now distinguish between situations in which they are constructed
inside a package, inside another module (nested module), or inside a script.
This behaviour is implemented in 'autoTopEncl' and can be overridden. This
behaviour defines the search path of a module.

  module and contains sufficient information for that process.
